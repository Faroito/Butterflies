# Butterflies

## Description

In mathematics I had to do a simulator of the evolution of butterflies.
For example, if you have 100 butterflies and a low growth rate, after many generations they will eventually die. 
If you have a normal growth rate their population will stabilize. 
Finally if there is a high growth rate, the population will be high but, due to a lack of food, many butterflies will die.

I first developped this algorithm in Python, then I designed a graphical interface in Javascript.
