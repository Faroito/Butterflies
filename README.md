# Butterflies

## Description

In mathematics I had to do an evolution simulator of butterflies, how with a growth rate, they will evolve. 

For exemple, if we have 100 butterflies and a low growth rate, after many generation they will eventually dies. If we have a normal growth rate their population will be stabilise. Finally if there is a hight growth rate, the popultion will be hight to but due to a lack of food many butterflies will dies.

So I first did this algorithm in Python, after I did a graphical interface in Javascript.
